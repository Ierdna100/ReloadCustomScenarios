Chasaroonie asked for it and I've been putting it off for like 26 years.\r\n\r\nThe mod reloads scenarios every time you enter the first editor window (with the selection to open campaigns, standalone missions or liveries).\r\n\r\nI'd recommend you enable Load On Start, makes it a lot easier as you won't need VR at all to use it!",
